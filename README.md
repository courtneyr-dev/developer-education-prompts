# Developer Education Prompts

A curated collection of prompts for creating documentation and training materials for developers at all levels - from vibe coders to experienced web developers.

## 📚 Purpose

This repository provides ready-to-use prompts that can be used with AI assistants (like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to generate educational content, explanations, and learning materials for web development topics.

## 🗂️ Structure

Prompts are organized by skill level:

- **`prompts/beginner/`** - For those just starting their development journey
- **`prompts/intermediate/`** - For developers with foundational knowledge looking to expand
- **`prompts/advanced/`** - For experienced developers tackling complex topics
- **`prompts/templates/`** - Templates for creating new prompts

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Browse the prompts in the appropriate skill level directory
