## Prompt Quality Guidelines

### Good Prompts Are:
- **Specific**: Clearly state what you want to learn or understand
- **Contextual**: Include relevant background and prerequisites
- **Actionable**: Request concrete examples and explanations
- **Educational**: Focus on teaching concepts, not just providing code
- **Well-structured**: Follow the template format

### Example of a Good Prompt:
```
I'm building a React application and need to understand state management. Can you:
1. Explain when to use local state vs context vs external libraries
2. Show examples of each approach
3. Discuss the trade-offs and best practices
4. Help me choose the right solution for my use case

My app has [specific details about your app]
```

### Example of a Poor Prompt:
```
Tell me about React.
```
(Too vague, no context, not actionable)

## Content Guidelines
