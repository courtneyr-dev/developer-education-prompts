# API Integration for Web Applications

## Purpose
Guide intermediate developers through integrating external APIs into their web applications.

## Target Audience
- Skill Level: Intermediate
- Prerequisites: Basic JavaScript, understanding of async operations, familiarity with HTTP requests

## Prompt

```
I want to integrate a REST API into my web application. Can you help me understand:
1. Best practices for making API requests (fetch vs axios)
2. How to handle authentication (API keys, OAuth)
3. Error handling strategies for API calls
4. How to manage loading states and display data
5. Caching strategies to optimize API usage

Please provide practical code examples using modern JavaScript (async/await).
```

## Example Usage
Use this prompt when you need to connect your web application to external services or build a data-driven application.

## Expected Outcome
- Working examples of API integration
- Understanding of authentication methods
- Error handling patterns
- Performance optimization techniques

## Tips
- Always check API documentation first
- Test API endpoints with tools like Postman before integrating
- Handle edge cases (network errors, timeouts, rate limits)
- Never expose API keys in client-side code
