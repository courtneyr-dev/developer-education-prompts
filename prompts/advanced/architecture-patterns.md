# Software Architecture Patterns for Scalable Applications

## Purpose
Guide advanced developers in choosing and implementing appropriate architecture patterns.

## Target Audience
- Skill Level: Advanced
- Prerequisites: Experience with large applications, design patterns, system design

## Prompt

```
I'm architecting a complex web application and need guidance on:
1. Comparing architectural patterns (MVC, MVVM, Clean Architecture, Hexagonal)
2. When to use microservices vs monolithic architecture
3. Implementing Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles
4. Event-driven architecture and message queuing
5. State management patterns in frontend applications
6. Handling cross-cutting concerns (logging, auth, error handling)
7. Designing for scalability and maintainability

Please include real-world examples and trade-offs for each approach.
```

## Example Usage
Use this when designing a new system or refactoring a growing application.

## Expected Outcome
- Deep understanding of architectural patterns
- Ability to choose appropriate patterns for specific needs
- Implementation examples with best practices
- Understanding of scalability considerations

## Tips
- Consider team size and expertise when choosing patterns
- Start simple and evolve architecture as needs grow
- Document architectural decisions (ADRs)
- Focus on separation of concerns and modularity
- Plan for change and flexibility
