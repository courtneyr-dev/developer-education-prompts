# Advanced Web Performance Optimization

## Purpose
Help experienced developers optimize web application performance using advanced techniques.

## Target Audience
- Skill Level: Advanced
- Prerequisites: Strong understanding of JavaScript, browser rendering, network protocols, and build tools

## Prompt

```
I need to optimize the performance of a large-scale web application. Can you provide guidance on:
1. Advanced code splitting and lazy loading strategies
2. Optimizing critical rendering path and reducing Time to Interactive (TTI)
3. Implementing effective caching strategies (service workers, CDN)
4. Memory leak detection and prevention
5. Web vitals optimization (LCP, FID, CLS)
6. Bundle size optimization and tree shaking
7. Server-side rendering vs static generation trade-offs

Include specific tools for measuring performance and real-world examples.
```

## Example Usage
Use this prompt when scaling an application or addressing performance bottlenecks in production.

## Expected Outcome
- Comprehensive performance optimization strategy
- Tool recommendations and usage examples
- Measurable improvements in key metrics
- Understanding of performance trade-offs

## Tips
- Always measure before and after optimizations
- Focus on user-centric metrics (Web Vitals)
- Use lighthouse and WebPageTest for auditing
- Consider the 80/20 rule - focus on biggest bottlenecks first
- Test on real devices and network conditions
